Amplify UI FaceLivenessDetector provides a UI component for Amazon Rekognition Face Liveness that helps developers verify that only real users, not bad actors using spoofs, can access your services.

More information on setting up and using the FaceLivenessDetector is in the [Amplify UI Face Liveness documentation](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/swift/connected-components/liveness).
